## Cyberbullying detection in text using machine learning and deep learning (v 1.0)
This repository contains python code to detect cyberbullying in text using machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine  (SVM), deep learning models like GRU + GloVe, and RoBERTa.

## Introduction
This repo contains python notebook.
Notebook 1: This notebook contains code for following work.
1. Data Loading
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data Analysis and plotting
4. Model Building
5. Model Evaluation

## Environment
This notebook is based on python 3.0+. Most of the library comes pre-installed with Google Colab. Rest required libraries can be installed by running first block of the code.

## Dataset
The dataset which has been used for this project can be found at (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/jf4pzyvnpj/1). Size of dataset is `64 mb` which contains 8 different csv in it. There are ------ columns out of which we will be using `Text` and `oh_label` for our analysis and modelling purpose.

#### NOTE: Data Processing could take lot of time so I have saved a copy of processed data. It can be found at this link (----------------------------).

## Data Pre-processing
After merging all 8 files, a single `dataframe` was created which has ----- number of rows. But this data has many duplicates rows and balnk rows aliong with other anamolies. Following list shows the data processing steps.
1. Converted all text to lower.
2.
